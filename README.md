# EMS On Scene: Team Support App for Campus Emergency Medical Services
*This is an open-source EMS App for gathering your EMS squad resources and communications into one cute & easily navigable app, better-streamlined your emergency service team organization.* 

*The objective is to share this app with other EMS teams out there who may be interested in taking this app and adapting it for their own teams. 
We are trying to make this app  more accessible for beginner developers, and are trying to create helpful tips and how-to guidelines.*
