## Step 2: Find About Phone

1.  Scroll down a bit and look for something called "About phone" or "About device." Tap on this option – it's like peeking behind the scenes.

## Step 3: Look for Build Number

1.  Inside the "About phone" section, you'll find a thing called "Build number." It might be under "Software information" or something similar.

## Step 4: Tap Build Number

## Step 5: Enter Your PIN/Password

1.  If your phone asks for your PIN, password, or pattern, go ahead and type it in. This is like showing your ID to prove you're allowed to do the cool stuff.

## Step 6: Find Developer Options

1.  After all that tapping, you'll notice a new menu called "Developer options" hanging around in the main Settings list. It's like a secret room for phone magic!

## Step 7: Go to Developer Options

1.  Tap on "Developer options" to discover a bunch of extra settings that you usually don't see. This is where the fun begins!

## Step 8: Turn on Developer Options

1.  Near the top of the "Developer options" page, there's a switch. Slide it to the right – it's like turning on a light – to activate Developer Options.

## Step 9: Check Out Developer Options

1.  Now that you've got Developer Options on, take a look around. There's stuff like "USB debugging," which helps your phone talk to your computer.

## Step 10: USB Debugging
